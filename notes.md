# OPTIONS

# 1 data:
  * coinbase
  * **gdax**

  = should use gdax, but what can i learn from different buy/sell prices?
  = what if i use gdax and make actual purchase price slightly higher/lower?

# 2 period:
  * **last 30 days**
  * since peak (40 days)
  * since movement (90 days)

# 3 crash:
  * **with crash**
  * without crash

  = still figuring this out. seems safer to include.

# 4 vars:
  * top 1
  * **avg top 5**
  * avg top 10
  * avg top 20
  * overall peak data (doesn't do as well...)

===========



notes:/to do next jul 25


-need to genrate 120 days for BTC and LTC

-maybe add 120 and 105 days to overnight sim

-make sim-vars page loo good. i need to use that

-test sim vars with real sim for specif values, make sure it gives same values. i didnt test a thing!

-update test vars!! make sure the have a buffer of both low high (upper and low) i think htey're hitting the edges right now


-live resutl is next - make it run for differnt vars --
and make sure the sgort term long term thing is still best

look at a full arary of rests and decide that... (120/105/90... line em up!)
decide whats best...
make them look the same as the exisitng page


maybe make .. add avg in the chart. like the other one. might be better

***really think about that stacked bar chart. there seem to be two big areas of combinations.**

-maybe i think about low ratio_bot and high_ratio bot

****put a period/offset stacked bar chart on im vars (or histogram)


*** IMPORNTANT**  why are there no 0.5 periods?!?!?!?!!

**IMPORNTA** does smBot() stop all other processes from running?!?!.. can i make it run in the background..? async? promise?
