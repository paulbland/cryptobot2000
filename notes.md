# OPTIONS

# 1 data:
  * coinbase
  * **gdax**

  = should use gdax, but what can i learn from different buy/sell prices?
  = what if i use gdax and make actual purchase price slightly higher/lower?

# 2 period:
  * **last 30 days**
  * since peak (40 days)
  * since movement (90 days)

# 3 crash:
  * **with crash**
  * without crash

  = still figuring this out. seems safer to include.

# 4 vars:
  * top 1
  * **avg top 5**
  * avg top 10
  * avg top 20
  * overall peak data (doesn't do as well...)
